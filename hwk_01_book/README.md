# Instructions

A book can be defined by its title, author, genre, and number of pages. To simplify the design, assume that a book can only have one author and genre. Users can create books by informing its title, author, genre, and number of pages (in this order). There are only 4 possible values for genre: "fiction", "non-fiction", "technical", and "biography".  If the informed genre is not valid, set it to "fiction". Define "toString" and a "isLong" method that returns true if the book has more than 300 pages. Define 300 as a class variable (static) constant (final).
