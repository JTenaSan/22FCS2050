# Instructions

Using the ArrayList class implemented in class, implement the following method: 

```
    // TODO: append the elements of the given array list (named source) to the (current) list
    public void copy(ArrayList source) {

    }
```

Hint: write a loop to get each individual element from source using "get" (index goes from 0 to < source.size()); then call append on the current list passing the element from source. 

# Submission 

For this assignment you just need to submit source code ArrayList.java through Canvas.
